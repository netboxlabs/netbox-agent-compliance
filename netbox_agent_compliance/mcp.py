"""
MCP helper module for stdio communication with NetBox MCP server.

This module handles the critical connection between the agent and NetBox:
- Spawns the NetBox MCP server as a subprocess
- Establishes secure stdio communication (no network exposure)
- Filters available tools for safety (read-only by default)
- Tracks metrics like tool call counts

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is the standard way to give LLMs access to
external tools and data sources in a controlled, auditable manner.

    Create an MCP server connection to the NetBox MCP server.

    This function sets up the critical bridge between the LLM agent and NetBox:
    1. Spawns the NetBox MCP server as a subprocess
    2. Passes NetBox credentials via environment variables (never in args)
    3. Filters tools to ensure only safe operations are exposed
    4. Returns a server handle that the agent can use

    The stdio approach (stdin/stdout) is used for security:
    - No network ports opened
    - Process isolation
    - Clear parent-child relationship
